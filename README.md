🕹️ Guess the Number Game – Batch Project A fun command-line game created using a .bat file where the player guesses a random number between 1 and 10. It gives hints like "Too high" or "Too low" and counts the number of tries. Easy to build and run using Notepad and double-click to play – no installation needed.
